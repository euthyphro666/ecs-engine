# ECS Engine

This is the rough beginnings of a game engine with monogame. 
Strictly speaking the project is as much as a bootstrapper
or boilerplate concept than an engine. The idea is to have 
some core project that can be used as a template or guide 
for future endevors down the road. 

The current state of the project is nowhere near finishd,
however, I do intend on coming back to it sometime in the
future.
