# Motivation

The primary reason behind creating this game engine stands as two fold. First it serves as an exercise in managing and desiging large projects. Many large code bases tend to become very relaxed in principle due to the inherent challenge of keeping a tight design to something so large in scope. Often the Micro Services design pattern is a simple remedy for this, howver, there are other times where makes more sense (or is simply more straight forward) to assume the traditional monolithic approach. Given this is the case it's useful to continually practice designing at a scope that presents a challenge.

The secondary reason behind this code base is levied by the strict utility that it will be able to muster. In the future I hope to actually use it in the development of games, either as a library, or simply as boilerplate/template code.
